        <h1 id="How-Electronic-Roulette-Works-ThePhone-Casino"><a href="#How-Electronic-Roulette-Works-ThePhone-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Electronic Roulette Works: ThePhone Casino"></a>How Electronic Roulette Works: ThePhone Casino</h1><p>The electronic roulette wheel is a popular attraction in casinos all over the world. People are often curious how it works and how they can use it to their advantage. The following article will give you a brief overview of how the electronic roulette wheel works and how you can make the most of it when playing at a casino.</p>
<p>The electronic roulette wheel is powered by a computer and contains a number of sensors that track the movement of the ball. When you place your bets, these sensors will calculate the winning bets and payout the appropriate amounts.</p>
<p>There are a few things you need to keep in mind when playing electronic roulette. First, always bet on even odds as this gives you the best chance of winning. Second, make sure to place your bets early as the odds change as the wheel spins. Finally, be aware that there is a house edge of around 2.7%, so you won’t win every time you play!</p>
<p>If you’re looking to try your hand at electronic roulette, ThePhone Casino is a great place to start. Not only do they offer a wide range of games, but they also have some of the best bonuses around. So why not give them a try today?</p>
<h1 id="How-Does-Electronic-Roulette-Work-at-ThePhone-Casino"><a href="#How-Does-Electronic-Roulette-Work-at-ThePhone-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Does Electronic Roulette Work at ThePhone Casino?"></a>How Does Electronic Roulette Work at ThePhone Casino?</h1><p>Roulette is one of the most popular casino games in the world. The Phone Casino offers two versions of this game – electronic roulette and live roulette. Both versions are very exciting, but there are some differences between them. In this article, we will discuss how electronic roulette works at ThePhone Casino.</p>
<p>Electronic roulette is played on a computerised roulette wheel. The wheel has 37 slots, numbered from 1 to 36, plus a 0 slot. Players bet on which number or group of numbers the ball will land in after the wheel is spun. The betting options are similar to those available in live roulette.</p>
<p>When you place a bet, your bet is displayed on the screen next to the wheel. The croupier then spins the wheel and drops the ball into the wheel, and the ball eventually comes to rest in a particular slot. If your bet matches the number where the ball landed, you win!</p>
<p>The beauty of electronic roulette is that you can play at your own pace. There’s no need to wait for other players to make their bets – you can place your bets as quickly or as slowly as you like. And if you want to take a break, you can just close the game and come back later.</p>
<p>Another advantage of playing electronic roulette is that you can always see what’s going on at the table. You don’t have to wait for someone to announce the result of each spin – it’s all shown on the screen in front of you. This makes it easy to follow how much money you’ve won or lost during a session.</p>
<p>If you want to try electronic roulette at ThePhone Casino, head over to our website and sign up for an account today!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Electronic-Roulette-at-ThePhone-Casino"><a href="#How-to-Play-Electronic-Roulette-at-ThePhone-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Electronic Roulette at ThePhone Casino"></a>How to Play Electronic Roulette at ThePhone Casino</h1><p>This guide is for players who would like to play Electronic Roulette at ThePhone Casino.</p>
<p>We will start with the basics - how to open an account and make a deposit. Then we will move on to playing the game itself.</p>
<p>To get started, head over to ThePhone Casino’s website and click on the ‘Sign Up’ button. You will be asked to provide some personal details, including your name, address and email address.</p>
<p>Once you have registered an account, you can make a deposit by clicking on the ‘Deposit’ button and selecting your preferred payment method. You can use Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, Paypal, Neteller or Skrill to deposit funds into your account.</p>
<p>Once you have deposited funds into your account, you can head over to the ‘Games’ tab and select ‘Roulette’. You will then see a list of the different types of Roulette available. Select ‘Electronic Roulette’ and click on the ‘Play Now’ button.</p>
<p>You will now see the Electronic Roulette game screen. To place a bet, select your chip size and click on the relevant betting area on the table. Your bet will then be placed. The payouts are shown in the payout table below the table.</p>
<p>To spin the wheel, click on the ‘Spin’ button. The wheel will then spin and come to a stop on a number or colour. If your number comes up, you win!</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Odds-of-Winning-at-Electronic-Roulette"><a href="#What-are-the-Odds-of-Winning-at-Electronic-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="What are the Odds of Winning at Electronic Roulette?"></a>What are the Odds of Winning at Electronic Roulette?</h1><p>If you are curious about the odds of winning at electronic roulette, you have come to the right place. In this article, we will take a look at the odds of winning at both single-player and multiplayer electronic roulette games.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the odds of winning at a single-player game. The odds of winning at a single-player game are usually about 2.7 percent. This means that if you bet on blackjack every time, you would only win about two out of every hundred games.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the odds of winning at a multiplayer game. The odds of winning at a multiplayer game vary depending on how many people are playing. However, in general, the odds are about the same as they are for a single-player game. This means that if you bet on blackjack every time, you would only win about two out of every hundred games.</p>
<h1 id="Tips-for-Playing-Electronic-Roulette-at-ThePhone-Casino"><a href="#Tips-for-Playing-Electronic-Roulette-at-ThePhone-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Playing Electronic Roulette at ThePhone Casino"></a>Tips for Playing Electronic Roulette at ThePhone Casino</h1><p>There are a few basic things that you need to do in order to give yourself the best chance of winning when playing electronic roulette at ThePhone Casino.</p>
<h2 id="Choose-Your-Bet-Carefully"><a href="#Choose-Your-Bet-Carefully" class="headerlink" title="Choose Your Bet Carefully"></a>Choose Your Bet Carefully</h2><p>One of the most important things to remember is that Roulette is a game of chance, and there is no guaranteed way to win. However, you can improve your chances by selecting your bets carefully. There are a variety of bets available, and each has a different payout rate. You should always research the different bets before placing any wagers, in order to make sure you are making the smartest choices.</p>
<h2 id="Use-Bonuses-Wisely"><a href="#Use-Bonuses-Wisely" class="headerlink" title="Use Bonuses Wisely"></a>Use Bonuses Wisely</h2><p>Another thing to keep in mind when playing electronic roulette is that casino bonuses can be extremely helpful. Most online casinos offer bonuses for new players, and these bonuses can be used to increase your chances of winning. Be sure to read the terms and conditions associated with any bonus before accepting it, so that you know exactly what you are getting into.</p>
<h2 id="Stay-Calm-and-Focused"><a href="#Stay-Calm-and-Focused" class="headerlink" title="Stay Calm and Focused"></a>Stay Calm and Focused</h2><p>Finally, it is important to stay calm and focused while playing electronic roulette. This game can be exciting, but it is important not to let your emotions get the best of you. If you start making hasty decisions or betting more than you can afford to lose, you are likely to end up losing money instead of winning it. Take your time, make informed decisions, and you will be more likely to come out on top.</p>

        <h1 id="The-Strategy-That-Wins-Over-And-Over-Again-Playing-Roulette"><a href="#The-Strategy-That-Wins-Over-And-Over-Again-Playing-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="The Strategy That Wins Over And Over Again Playing Roulette"></a>The Strategy That Wins Over And Over Again Playing Roulette</h1><p>There is one simple, but highly effective strategy to winning at roulette – and that is by playing the even money bets. This may seem like a basic strategy, but it is one that has been proven to work time and time again. Here are a few reasons why you should stick to playing even money bets when playing roulette:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You have a 50/50 chance of winning with even money bets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The odds are relatively in your favour, giving you a better chance of walking away a winner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even money bets are simpler to play than other types of bets, making them a good option for beginners.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if you want to up your chances of winning at roulette, make sure you stick to playing even money bets!</p>
<h1 id="The-Truth-About-Roulette-Systems"><a href="#The-Truth-About-Roulette-Systems" class="headerlink" title="The Truth About Roulette Systems"></a>The Truth About Roulette Systems</h1><p>There is no one definitive answer to the question of whether or not roulette systems work. Some systems are more likely to produce results than others, but in the end it all comes down to chance. </p>
<p>One popular system is the Martingale System. This system is based on doubling your bet after every loss until you eventually win. This system does have the potential to produce results, but it also has a high risk of losing everything you have wagered. </p>
<p>Another system that can be successful is the Fibonacci System. This system involves increasing your bet by following a specific sequence of numbers based on the Fibonacci sequence. This sequence is believed to be more statistically probable to produce a win than other sequences. </p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no foolproof system for winning at roulette. However, if you are comfortable with the risks involved and have some luck on your side, then using a specific system can be a way to improve your chances of winning.</p>
<h1 id="What-Works-And-What-Doesn’t-Testing-Roulette-Systems"><a href="#What-Works-And-What-Doesn’t-Testing-Roulette-Systems" class="headerlink" title="What Works And What Doesn’t - Testing Roulette Systems"></a>What Works And What Doesn’t - Testing Roulette Systems</h1><p>There are a lot of systems being touted as the next big thing in roulette, but many of them don’t work. In this article, we’ll take a look at what does and doesn’t work when it comes to roulette systems and betting strategies.</p>
<p>One popular system is simply called “The System.” The basic premise is that you bet on black or red, odd or even, and high or low. When you win, you keep your winnings and reset your bets to the starting amount. When you lose, you double your bet for the next spin. This system can be profitable in the long run, but it’s also risky since you can lose a lot of money quickly if you hit several losing spins in a row.</p>
<p>Another system that can be profitable is the Martingale System. This system is similar to The System, but instead of doubling your bet when you lose, you raise your bet by one unit. The advantage of this system is that it has a lower risk than The System since you only have to raise your bet by one unit when you lose rather than doubling it. However, the downside of this system is that it can be very expensive if you hit a run of bad luck.</p>
<p>There are also many betting strategies that can be used in combination with these systems. One popular strategy is the Paroli System. This strategy calls for increasing your bet by one unit after every win, up to a certain point limit. If you lose after reaching the limit, you go back to your original bet amount. This strategy can be profitable if you have a winning streak, but it can also lead to big losses if you hit a losing streak.</p>
<p>Another popular betting strategy is the D’Alembert Strategy. With this strategy, you increase your bets by one unit after every loss, up to a certain point limit. If you win after reaching the limit, you go back to your original bet amount. This strategy also has a higher chance of winning than losing over time, but it’s not as risky as the Martingale System since it only increases bets by one unit each time instead of doubling them.</p>
<p>As with any gambling game, there is no guaranteed way to win money playing roulette. However, using these systems along with sound betting strategies can give you a better chance of winning in the long run. So before risking your hard-earned money on some newfangled roulette system, make sure to do your research and see which ones actually work before trying them out yourself!</p>
<h1 id="Do-Hotel-Roulette-Games-Offer-Better-Odds"><a href="#Do-Hotel-Roulette-Games-Offer-Better-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Do Hotel Roulette Games Offer Better Odds?"></a>Do Hotel Roulette Games Offer Better Odds?</h1><p>Hotel roulette games are becoming more popular these days as people look for ways to stretch their entertainment dollar. What are the odds of winning, and do they offer better odds than other types of casino games?</p>
<p>Roulette is a game that has been around for centuries. The basic premise is to guess where a ball will land after it’s spun around in a wheel. There are a number of different bets you can make, with odds that vary depending on the bet. The house edge on most bets is around 2.7%, which means that for every $100 you bet, you can expect to lose $2.70 in the long run.</p>
<p>While this may not seem like much, it’s important to remember that roulette is a game of chance. You could easily lose much more than this amount in any given session. That said, there are some bets that offer better odds than others. For example, betting on black or red gives you odds of 1-1, while betting on a single number gives you odds of 36-1.</p>
<p>While roulette offers decent odds compared to other casino games, there is no guarantee that you will win any money playing it. In fact, you could very easily lose your entire bankroll playing roulette if you’re not careful. If you’re looking for a game with better odds, it’s best to stick to games like blackjack or craps where the house edge is much lower.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Win-More-At-Online-Roulette-Test-Your-System"><a href="#How-To-Win-More-At-Online-Roulette-Test-Your-System" class="headerlink" title="How To Win More At Online Roulette - Test Your System!"></a>How To Win More At Online Roulette - Test Your System!</h1><p>It can be frustrating when you’re playing online roulette and it seems like the odds are always against you. While there’s no foolproof way to win every time, there are a few tips and tricks that might help you tilt the odds in your favor.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your chances is to test your system. This means figuring out what betting patterns work for you and sticking to them. Sometimes luck is on your side, but more often than not, success in roulette comes down to patience and a strategic approach.</p>
<p>Another key element of winning at online roulette is choosing the right casino. Make sure to research the different options available to you and compare their features before making a decision. In addition, be sure to read reviews from other players to get an idea of what’s offered by different casinos.</p>
<p>Finally, remember to have fun! Roulette can be a thrilling game, but it’s important not to take it too seriously. If you’re relaxed and confident in your abilities, you’re more likely to walk away a winner.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Nevada-Leads-The-Nation-In-Sports-Betting-Revenue"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-The-Nation-In-Sports-Betting-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads The Nation In Sports Betting Revenue"></a>Nevada Leads The Nation In Sports Betting Revenue</h1><p>Nevada topped every other state in sports betting revenue last year with $248.4 million, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board. The next closest state was New Jersey, which generated $170 million in sports betting revenue in 2018.</p>
<p>The meteoric rise of sports betting can be attributed to the growing popularity of legalized gambling and the increasing availability of mobile apps and websites that make it easier than ever to place a bet. In addition, the expansion of legalized sports betting to additional states has made it more convenient for Americans to bet on sporting events.</p>
<p>States that have recently legalized sports betting include New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Mississippi, and Rhode Island. Sports betting is also legal in Nevada, Delaware, and Oregon, but these states do not offer as many options for placing bets as the states that have recently legalized it.</p>
<p>The NFL has also embraced sports betting, with teams like the Oakland Raiders and Washington Redskins opening up casinos with sportsbooks inside of them. The NFL has even partnered with Caesars Entertainment to create a Super Bowl contest in which fans can win trips to the game.</p>
<p>The growth of sports betting is likely to continue in the coming years, as more states legalize it and the NFL continues to embrace it. This could lead to increased revenue for Nevada and other states that have embraced legalized gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Sports-Betting-Revenues-Soar"><a href="#Delaware-Sports-Betting-Revenues-Soar" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Sports Betting Revenues Soar"></a>Delaware Sports Betting Revenues Soar</h1><p>Delaware sports betting revenues have soared in recent months, as the state’s gambling industry continues to grow.</p>
<p>The Delaware Lottery reports that sports betting revenues totaled $9.7 million in July, up from $7.8 million in June and just $3.5 million in May. That brings the total for the first seven months of the year to $62.4 million,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> more than double the amount generated during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Much of that growth is due to the expansion of sports betting options in Delaware, including the launch of mobile wagering in late May. In July, 59% of all sports bets were placed online, generating nearly $5.8 million in revenue.</p>
<p>“We are extremely pleased with how well our sports betting operation is performing thus far this year,” said lottery director Vernon Kirk. “The addition of mobile wagering has been a big hit with our players, and we expect continued strong growth throughout the remainder of 2018.”</p>
<p>Delaware was one of the first states to legalize sports betting after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May. The court ruling allowed states to decide whether to allow gambling on individual sporting events, and Delaware moved quickly to authorize both online and retail wagering at its three casinos and racetracks.</p>
<p>The state currently offers odds on 25 different sports, including major league baseball, football and basketball games.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Sports-Betting-Reaches-Milestone"><a href="#New-Jersey-Sports-Betting-Reaches-Milestone" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Sports Betting Reaches Milestone"></a>New Jersey Sports Betting Reaches Milestone</h1><p>It was a big day for sports betting in New Jersey as Monmouth Park Racetrack marked a major milestone by taking its first legal bet.</p>
<p>After months of delays, the racetrack finally opened its sports book on Thursday, accepting wagers on games from the NFL pre-season.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to finally be open for business,” said Dennis Drazin, the chairman and CEO of Darby Development LLC, which operates Monmouth Park.</p>
<p>Drazin had been critical of the delays caused by the state Legislature and Gov. Phil Murphy, but he was all smiles on Thursday as he took the first legal bet at the track.</p>
<p>The NFL pre-season got underway on Thursday night with the New York Giants taking on the Cleveland Browns, and while most people were probably watching that game, there was also some action going on at Monmouth Park.</p>
<p>The track took bets on both teams, but New York was a 7.5-point favorite and most of the money was wagered on them. The Giants ended up winning 17-10, so not many people made any money off that game.</p>
<p>But there will be plenty of opportunities for that in the coming weeks and months, as Monmouth Park ramps up its operations and other tracks in New Jersey open their sports books as well.</p>
<p>This is a huge development for sports betting in the United States, as it paves the way for other states to legalize it as well. Nevada has had legal sports betting for years, but this is a major step forward for it nationwide.</p>
<p>There are still some kinks to work out, such as how to handle mobile betting, but overall things seem to be moving in a positive direction.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Sports-Betting-Revenue-Continues-To-Grow"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Sports-Betting-Revenue-Continues-To-Grow" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Sports Betting Revenue Continues To Grow"></a>Pennsylvania Sports Betting Revenue Continues To Grow</h1><p>In the month of January, Pennsylvania sports betting revenue totaled $16,7 million. That number is up from December’s total of $14.8 million and November’s total of $10.9 million.</p>
<p>These numbers underscore the steady growth in the Keystone State’s sports betting market. The state’s 12 casinos now offer legal sports betting, and Pennsylvania has seen a total of $77 million in wagers since sports betting went live last September.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this continued growth. First, Pennsylvania’s market is growing more competitive as more casinos add sports betting options. Second, the NFL playoffs have been highly popular among bettors, driving up overall handle (the total amount wagered). And finally, Pennsylvanians continue to embrace legal sports betting as a fun and exciting way to add some excitement to their lives.</p>
<p>While it’s still early in the year, these latest numbers suggest that Pennsylvania’s sports betting market is on track for another strong performance in 2019.</p>
<h1 id="West-Virginia-Sees-Huge-Increase-In-Sports-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#West-Virginia-Sees-Huge-Increase-In-Sports-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="West Virginia Sees Huge Increase In Sports Gambling Revenue"></a>West Virginia Sees Huge Increase In Sports Gambling Revenue</h1><p>According to a new report from the West Virginia Lottery, sports gambling revenue has increased by more than $27 million in the past year. This represents a huge increase of more than 150%, and it is clear that sports gambling is becoming increasingly popular in the state.</p>
<p>The main reason for this surge in popularity is undoubtedly the arrival of legal sports betting. In May 2018, West Virginia became one of the first states to legalize sports betting following the repeal of PASPA. This has allowed casinos and other gaming establishments to offer a range of sports betting options, and it seems that this has been a big hit with players.</p>
<p>It is not just casinos that are benefiting from this surge in sports gambling; online bookmakers are also seeing a rise in business. In fact, many online bookmakers are now offering their services to residents of West Virginia, and this is likely to continue as the popularity of sports betting grows.</p>
<p>One of the main benefits of legalizing sports betting is that it can help to generate much-needed revenue for state governments. This appears to be the case in West Virginia, where the increase in revenue will be used to support important causes such as education and infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether other states will follow suit and legalize sports betting, but there is no doubt that this is a growing industry. With so many people enjoying wagering on sporting events, it seems likely that this trend will continue for some time to come.</p>

<li><p>Decide which casino to beat. You can do this by researching the different casinos and finding the one with the worst odds. The main reason people lose money at casinos is because they don’t pick the right one to play at.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Familiarise yourself with the games. This may seem like a no-brainer, but you would be surprised how many people dive into playing without knowing how the game works.

<li><p>Use bonuses wisely. Many Casinos offer new players sign-up bonuses as an incentive to join their site. However, these bonuses often come with wagering requirements – i.e., you need to bet a certain amount before you can withdraw any winnings attained from using them . Make sure you understand these requirements before accepting any bonus offers from online casinos!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>7 . exploit casino loopholes . Casinos are in business to make money, which means thatthey often have loopholes in their systems that gamblers can exploit .

<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Blackjack-in-Internet-Casinos"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Blackjack-in-Internet-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Blackjack in Internet Casinos"></a>How to Win at Blackjack in Internet Casinos</h1><p>Most people who enjoy gambling at brick-and-mortar casinos also like to gamble online. One of the most popular online casino games is blackjack. In order to be a successful blackjack player in an online casino, there are a few things you need to know.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is find a reputable and reliable online casino. There are many good ones available, so take your time and do some research before settling on one.</p>
<p>Once you’ve registered with an online casino, you will need to download their software. This will allow you to play blackjack and other games on your computer.</p>
<p>Once you have the software installed, you will need to open an account and make a deposit. Most online casinos accept major credit cards and Paypal.</p>
<p>Now that you’re registered and have deposited funds into your account, it’s time to start playing blackjack. The basic rules of the game are fairly simple: The player tries to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over; the dealer must draw cards until they reach 16 or more; any card totaling 10 points is worth 10 points (e.g., an ace plus a six is 16).</p>
<p>There are a few strategies that can help players improve their chances of winning at blackjack:</p>
<p>• Never split pairs of eights or aces.<br>8s are bad hands because the only way to improve them is to draw a 3, which gives the player just a one in three chance of winning; splitting aces means that each ace becomes two new hands, which greatly reduces the odds of winning either hand.<br>9s are good hands because they can be split into two hands without much risk; this gives the player two chances to win instead of one.<br>10s and face cards are considered “neutral” cards and can be split or kept as is depending on the player’s strategy.<br>When dealt two consecutive cards of the same rank (e.g., two fives), players should always Split them unless they hold an Ace, in which case they should Double Down . Splitting allows players to wager twice as much money on two separate hands, increasing their chances of winning overall. If both cards dealt are of different ranks (e.g., four and queen), then players should hit , since this gives them the best chance of getting closer to 21 without going bust..</p>
<p> When playing Internet blackjack, always remember these basic rules and strategies!</p>

We’ll cover the basic rules of the game, as well as some strategy tips that will help you make the most of your bets. So read on for all the information you need to start raking in the wins!</p>
<p>The Basic Rules of Blackjack</p>
<p>Before we get into the strategy, let’s first take a look at the basic rules of blackjack. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (a “blackjack”), or by reaching a total that’s closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand. You can hit (draw another card), stand (end your turn), split (double your bet and play two hands), or double down (double your bet and receive just one more card).</p>
<p>When it comes to betting, you can choose to bet anything from 1 credit up to 500 credits per hand. The value of each credit varies depending on the online casino site you’re playing at, but generally speaking, credits are worth anywhere from $0.01 up to $5 each. So if you were playing at a casino where each credit was worth $0.50, and you bet 25 credits per hand, your total stake for each round would be $12.50.</p>
<p>Now that we know the basics, let’s move on to some tips for how best to play blackjack online!</p>
<p>Strategy Tips for Blackjack Online</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Don’t Bust - One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is not to bust (go over 21). If your first two cards add up to more than 21, then you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer does. So always make sure that you don’t go over 21 with your total score.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know When To Stand - Another important thing to remember is when to stand (stop drawing additional cards). You should always stand when your total score is 17 or higher, because going any further could lead to a bust. And remember – if the dealer has a 2, 3, 4 or 5 showing, then they will definitely draw another card (unless they already have 16 or lower), so it’s usually best not to risk going over 21 if they’re still in play.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use Basic Strategy - Using basic strategy is one of the easiest ways to improve your chances of winning at blackjack online. Basic strategy involves making decisions based on what cards are left in the deck and what’s been revealed so far in the current hand. There are plenty of resources available online that will show you exactly how to apply basic strategy for each possible scenario, so be sure utilise them!</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Break-the-Bank-at-Internet-Casinos"><a href="#How-to-Break-the-Bank-at-Internet-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="How to Break the Bank at Internet Casinos"></a>How to Break the Bank at Internet Casinos</h1><p>There are many advantages to gambling at internet casinos. Perhaps the biggest benefit is that you can gamble from the comfort of your own home, without having to drive or fly anywhere. In addition, online casinos typically offer a wider range of games than traditional casinos do.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for breaking the bank at internet casinos:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose an established and reputable casino. There are many shady operators in the online gambling world, so it’s important to choose a casino that has a good reputation and is licensed and regulated by a respected authority such as the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gamble responsibly. Gambling should be enjoyed as a form of entertainment, and not used as a means to make money. Make sure you have enough money set aside to cover your losses, and don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do your research. Before playing any game, familiarize yourself with the rules and how the odds work. This will help you make better-informed betting decisions and give you a better chance of winning money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use bonuses wisely. Many online casinos offer sign-up bonuses and other promotional offers, so be sure to take advantage of these deals when possible. However, make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully before accepting any bonus, as there may be restrictions on which games you can play or how much you can withdraw.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play games with high payouts. Some games offer better odds than others, so it’s wise to focus your bets on those games where the potential payoff is highest. For example, blackjack, baccarat and craps offer relatively good odds for players who know what they’re doing, while slots offer some of the worst odds in the casino industry.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay disciplined. It’s easy to get carried away when you’re winning, but it’s important to stick to your betting plan and not over-invest in any one game or round. Likewise, if you start losing money, don’t panic - there’s always another round coming up shortly.”</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <h1 id="How-to-Tell-If-a-Slot-Machine-is-Progressive"><a href="#How-to-Tell-If-a-Slot-Machine-is-Progressive" class="headerlink" title="How to Tell If a Slot Machine is Progressive"></a>How to Tell If a Slot Machine is Progressive</h1><p>Casinos are always looking for new ways to make money, and one of the ways they do this is by making their slot machines progressive. This means that a portion of the money played in the machine goes into a pot that accumulates over time, and eventually someone will hit the jackpot and take home a large sum of money. If you’re interested in playing at a progressive slot machine, it’s important to know how to tell if a slot machine is progressive.</p>
<p>One way to determine if a slot machine is progressive is to look at the payout chart. Progressive machines will usually have a higher payout percentage than regular machines. In addition, many casinos have signs posted near their progressive machines informing players that these are the machines with the bigger payouts.</p>
<p>Another way to tell if a slot machine is progressive is by looking at the logo on the machine. Progressive machines will typically have either a royal flush or diamond logo somewhere on the front of the machine.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure whether or not a particular slot machine is progressive, don’t be afraid to ask one of the casino employees. They should be able to answer any questions you have about the different machines available at the casino.</p>
<p>So, now that you know how to tell if a slot machine is progressive, what’s stopping you from trying your luck at one of these machines? Head on over to your nearest casino and give them a try!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Tell-if-a-Slot-Machine-is-Winning"><a href="#How-to-Tell-if-a-Slot-Machine-is-Winning" class="headerlink" title="How to Tell if a Slot Machine is Winning"></a>How to Tell if a Slot Machine is Winning</h1><p>There are a few things to look for when trying to determine if a slot machine is winning or losing. One sign is if the machine pays out frequently. If it doesn’t, then it may be losing. In addition, take note of how much money is being inserted into the machine and how much money is being paid out. If the machine is paying out less than people are putting in, it’s likely losing. Finally, watch the symbols and notice if they’re coming up often. This can be a sign that the machine is hot and paying out more often than usual.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Know-if-a-Slot-Machine-is-Rigged"><a href="#How-to-Know-if-a-Slot-Machine-is-Rigged" class="headerlink" title="How to Know if a Slot Machine is Rigged"></a>How to Know if a Slot Machine is Rigged</h1><p>There are a few ways that people try to determine if a slot machine is rigged. One way is to look at the payout percentage that is displayed on the machine. This percentage should be around 95% in order for the slot machine to be considered fair. However, many machines have been known to payout less than this amount, so it can be difficult to trust this number.</p>
<p>Another way that people try to determine if a slot machine is rigged is by watching other people play the machines. This can be helpful because it can show you which machines are paying out and which ones are not. If you see someone playing a machine and winning over and over again, then it is likely that the machine is rigged. However, if you see someone playing a machine and losing over and over again, then it is likely that the machine is fair.</p>
<p>Another thing to look out for when trying to determine if a slot machine is rigged is how often the jackpot hits. If the jackpot only hits once every few thousand plays, then it is likely that the machine is rigged. However, if the jackpot hits frequently, then it is likely that the machine is fair.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Check-if-a-Slot-Machine-is-Ready-to-Pay-Out"><a href="#How-to-Check-if-a-Slot-Machine-is-Ready-to-Pay-Out" class="headerlink" title="How to Check if a Slot Machine is Ready to Pay Out"></a>How to Check if a Slot Machine is Ready to Pay Out</h1><p>If you’ve ever played the slots, you know that there’s nothing more frustrating than putting in your money and watching the reels spin for what feels like hours with no payout in sight. So, is there a way to tell before you start playing if a slot machine is ready to pay out?</p>
<p>Actually, there is. It’s called the “hot and cold” theory, and it states that machines tend to payout more when they’re “hot” and less when they’re “cold.” In other words, if a machine has been paying out regularly, it’s likely in a hot streak and ready to payout again; but if it hasn’t been paying out at all, it’s likely in a cold streak and not likely to pay out anytime soon.</p>
<p>So how can you use this information to your advantage? Well, the easiest way is to ask the casino personnel. Most casinos have attendants who can tell you which machines are currently paying out and which ones aren’t. However, if you don’t want to bother them or if they’re not available, there are other ways to check as well.</p>
<p>One way is to watch how other people are playing the machine. If most of the people are winning then it’s probably in a hot streak and ready to payout. But if most of the people are losing then it’s probably in a cold streak. You can also check the payout percentage of the machine. The higher the payout percentage, the hotter the machine is likely to be.</p>
<p>But no matter what method you use, remember that these are only general guidelines; sometimes machines that are in hot streaks don’t pay out and machines that are in cold streaks do payout. So always use your best judgement when playing slots and never bet more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Tell-If-a-Slot-Machine-is-Worth-Playing"><a href="#How-to-Tell-If-a-Slot-Machine-is-Worth-Playing" class="headerlink" title="How to Tell If a Slot Machine is Worth Playing"></a>How to Tell If a Slot Machine is Worth Playing</h1><p>When you’re playing slot machines, it can be tough to tell whether a particular machine is worth playing or not. There are a few things you can look for, however, that can help you make your decision.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is how tight the slot machine is. If the payout percentage is low, then it’s likely not worth playing. Another thing to look at is the amount of money you stand to win if you hit the jackpot. If the jackpot is small, then it might not be worth your time.</p>
<p>You should also take into account how often the machine pays out. If it doesn’t pay out often, then it’s probably not worth playing. Finally, you should look at the size of the bets. If you have to bet a lot of money to win a small prize, then it’s probably not worth your time.</p>
<p>Overall, there are several things you can look at to determine whether a slot machine is worth playing or not. By considering these factors, you can make an informed decision about which slots are worth your time and money.</p>

        <h1 id="Florida-bill-looks-to-legalize-Major-League-Soccer"><a href="#Florida-bill-looks-to-legalize-Major-League-Soccer" class="headerlink" title="Florida bill looks to legalize Major League Soccer"></a>Florida bill looks to legalize Major League Soccer</h1><p>A recently proposed bill in the Florida state legislature looks to legitimize Major League Soccer (MLS) in the state.</p>
<p>The “Florida Soccer Promotion Act”, filed by Representative Rene Plasencia on January 9th, would exempt MLS games from state gambling laws. This would allow professional soccer clubs in Florida to operate wagering kiosks at their venues, as well as offer betting on their games.</p>
<p>Plasencia, a Republican from Orlando, is a self-proclaimed soccer fan and believes that the sport can bring economic benefit to the state. “This bill creates another avenue for fans to not only support their local team but also gamble on the game,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>MLS has been growing rapidly in recent years, with 23 teams currently competing in the league. Florida has been without an MLS club since Miami Fusion and Tampa Bay Mutiny were both shut down in 2001. If the bill is passed, it could open up the door for a new MLS team in Florida.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether or not the bill will pass, but there is certainly some interest in bringing MLS to the Sunshine State.</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-Major-League-Soccer-illegal-in-Florida"><a href="#Why-is-Major-League-Soccer-illegal-in-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Why is Major League Soccer illegal in Florida?"></a>Why is Major League Soccer illegal in Florida?</h1><p>In May of 2017, the state of Florida shut down a professional soccer league, deeming it unlawful. This particular soccer league, Major League Soccer (MLS), was seeking to establish a presence in Florida by hosting exhibition matches between its teams. However, the state determined that MLS does not comply with Florida’s statutes governing professional sports leagues.</p>
<p>So, what makes MLS illegal in Florida? The main issue appears to be the fact that MLS restricts its ownership to a single entity – meaning that one company controls all of the teams in the league. This arrangement is different from other major U.S. sports leagues, such as the NBA and NFL, which allow for individual team ownership. In Florida, this mono-entity structure is deemed a violation of antitrust law.</p>
<p>There are other criticisms of MLS as well. For instance, some argue that it is not as financially accessible to fans as other major sports leagues. Additionally, MLS has been criticized for its limited number of teams (just 22) and its lack of global appeal.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, MLS has continued to grow in popularity in recent years. The league now boasts a viewership that rivals that of the NHL and NBA. And with new franchises set to debut in Miami and Nashville over the next few years, MLS looks poised for continued expansion.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-lawmakers-ponder-legalizing-Major-League-Soccer"><a href="#Florida-lawmakers-ponder-legalizing-Major-League-Soccer" class="headerlink" title="Florida lawmakers ponder legalizing Major League Soccer"></a>Florida lawmakers ponder legalizing Major League Soccer</h1><p>Florida lawmakers are thinking about legalizing Major League Soccer in the state, which would give the Miami Beckham United ownership group a chance to bring an MLS expansion team to Miami.</p>
<p>The Florida House of Representatives Tourism and Economic Development Subcommittee unanimously voted Wednesday in favor of a proposal that would allow professional sports leagues, such as MLS, to operate in the state without abiding by regulations that govern other businesses.</p>
<p>The bill must now go before two more House committees before it could be brought to a full vote.</p>
<p>If it passes, the Miami Beckham United ownership group would no longer need local government approval to bring an MLS expansion team to Miami. The group has been attempting to bring an MLS team to Miami for over four years but has hit several roadblocks, including opposition from local politicians and zoning issues.</p>
<p>“This is something that we’ve been working on for some time,” David Beckham said of the proposed bill in February. “We want to make sure that we can bring a team here quickly and we have a stadium that we can call home. This is a big step, but it’s one that’s going to be very positive for our fans and for our city.”</p>
<p>MLS currently has 24 teams and is expecting two more teams by 2020. The league plans to have 28 teams by 2021.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Major-League-Soccer-illegal-in-Florida-due-to-gambling-concerns"><a href="#Is-Major-League-Soccer-illegal-in-Florida-due-to-gambling-concerns" class="headerlink" title="Is Major League Soccer illegal in Florida due to gambling concerns?"></a>Is Major League Soccer illegal in Florida due to gambling concerns?</h1><p>In The Sunshine State, there has been some debate over the legality of Major League Soccer (MLS) due to gambling concerns. Gambling has been a part of Florida culture for many years, and the state has been a hotbed for casino gambling in particular. As a result, some people argue that MLS games should not be allowed in the state due to the potential for illegal gambling activity.</p>
<p>However, others contend that MLS is no different than other professional sports leagues, and that there is no evidence that it leads to increased gambling activity. They argue that fans of MLS are just as likely to gamble on other sporting events, and that the league should not be penalized because of its association with gambling.</p>
<p>So far, Florida has not taken any official action on this issue. However, it is something that is likely to come up again as MLS continues to grow in popularity.</p>
<h1 id="Orlando-City-SC-pushing-for-legalization-of-Major-League-Soccer-in-Florida"><a href="#Orlando-City-SC-pushing-for-legalization-of-Major-League-Soccer-in-Florida" class="headerlink" title="Orlando City SC pushing for legalization of Major League Soccer in Florida"></a>Orlando City SC pushing for legalization of Major League Soccer in Florida</h1><p>Orlando City SC is working to help legalize Major League Soccer (MLS) in the state of Florida. The move would allow for additional teams to be established in the region, and provide a more structured system for professional soccer in the state.</p>
<p>Orlando City SC is no stranger to supporting important causes. The team has been a vocal advocate for MLS legalization in Florida, and is continuing its work to make sure that the legislation moves forward. This would be a major victory for the club, and its fans, as it would provide stability for MLS in the region.</p>
<p>There are a number of important reasons why MLS should be legalized in Florida. First and foremost, it would give more residents of the state an opportunity to enjoy top-level professional soccer. In addition, it would create new economic opportunities for the region, including jobs and tourism spending. Finally, it would help improve the quality of soccer in Florida overall.</p>
<p>The Orlando City SC organization is committed to making this happen, and is urging supporters to reach out to their local legislators to show their support for the effort. With your help, we can make this dream a reality!</p>

Here are our top 10 tips for playing blackjack:</h1><ol>
<li><p>Make sure you understand the basic rules of the game before playing. This will give you a good foundation on which to build your strategies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always bet within your means. Don’t risk too much money on any one hand – it could lead to disaster if things don’t go your way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stick to basic blackjack strategy as much as possible. This will help reduce the house edge and increase your chances of winning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the dealer has an ace up their sleeve, be careful when deciding whether or not to hit or stand. A strong hand could become weaker if the dealer gets another ace as their second card.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remember that insurance is only worth taking if the dealer has an ace showing as their first card – otherwise, it’s usually not worth the gamble.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use card counting techniques to help you determine when it’s favourable to bet big or keep things low-key. This takes practice but can be a very effective way of increasing your odds of winning over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware of the different blackjack variants available and choose the one that best suits your playing style. Some variants offer better odds than others so make sure you do your research before playing them!</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you find yourself losing more hands than usual, take a break from the game until you feel refreshed and ready to play again. Losing streaks happen to everyone – don’t let them get the better of you!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>9.. Always remember that blackjack is a game of chance and no amount of strategy can guarantee victory every time. Keep this in mind when gambling and try not to let losses affect your overall gaming experience adversely..</p>
<h1 id="How-to-play-Pure-Casino-The-basics"><a href="#How-to-play-Pure-Casino-The-basics" class="headerlink" title="How to play Pure Casino: The basics"></a>How to play Pure Casino: The basics</h1><p>If you’re looking to learn how to play casino, Pure Casino is the perfect place to do so. In this article, we will take you through the basics of the game.</p>
<p>To begin, each player is dealt two cards face down. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting closest to 21 without going over (called a blackjack), or by having a higher value hand than the dealer. In order to achieve this, players can either hit (draw another card) or stand (stick with the cards they have).</p>
<p>If you go over 21, you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer’s hand is. In addition, any blackjack pays out at 3:2 odds rather than even money - so it’s always worth aiming for those!</p>
<p>When both players have finished their hands, the dealer reveals their cards and either pays out or takes money from players accordingly. That’s all there is to it - now it’s time to put your skills into practice!</p>
<h1 id="Improve-your-Pure-Casino-Strategy-with-just-a-few-tweaks"><a href="#Improve-your-Pure-Casino-Strategy-with-just-a-few-tweaks" class="headerlink" title="Improve your Pure Casino Strategy with just a few tweaks"></a>Improve your Pure Casino Strategy with just a few tweaks</h1><p>There are a few Pure Casino strategy adjustments you can make in order to improve your play and give yourself a better chance of winning. Below we will discuss some tweaks that you can make to your game, as well as some basic advice that all players should stick to.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adjust your bet size</li>
</ol>
<p>Making small bets will not get you very far when playing casino games. In order to win big, you will need to place larger bets. This does come with risk, but if you can manage your bankroll wisely and accurately predict the outcomes of each game, then you stand to make a lot of money. Just be sure not to bet more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Be selective about the games you play</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all casino games are created equal. Some games offer players a better chance at winning than others. If you want to improve your chances of walking away a winner, then focus on playing the games that offer the best odds. Blackjack, craps and baccarat are all great options, while slots and roulette offer lower odds and should be avoided if possible.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Practice makes perfect</li>
</ol>
<p>The more you practice, the better your chances of winning will be. This is especially true for those who are new to casino gaming. Playing free demo versions of games is a great way to learn the ropes without risking any real money. Once you feel comfortable with how each game works, then switch over to playing for real money wages. You may not win every time, but if you stick to these tips and play smartly, you’ll definitely see an improvement in your overall results.</p>
<h1 id="Discover-the-power-of-playing-multiple-hands-in-Pure-Casino"><a href="#Discover-the-power-of-playing-multiple-hands-in-Pure-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Discover the power of playing multiple hands in Pure Casino"></a>Discover the power of playing multiple hands in Pure Casino</h1><p>If you love the thrill of the casino, you’ll love playing multiple hands in Pure Casino. Not only does this increase your chances of winning, but it also makes the game more exciting.</p>
<p>Playing multiple hands means that you’re dealt several cards at once, and you need to choose which ones to keep and which ones to discard. This can be a lot of fun, and it’s a great way to make the most of your money.</p>
<p>When you’re playing multiple hands, it’s important to remember that the odds are still against you. However, by making smart choices and playing strategically, you can give yourself the best chance of winning.</p>
<p>One of the best things about playing multiple hands is that it allows you to spread your risk. If you only have a small amount of money to spend, playing multiple hands is a great way to increase your chances of winning without risking too much money.</p>

        <h1 id="MLS-teams-battle-for-the-Baccarat-cup"><a href="#MLS-teams-battle-for-the-Baccarat-cup" class="headerlink" title="MLS teams battle for the Baccarat cup!"></a>MLS teams battle for the Baccarat cup!</h1><p>The MLS Cup is the annual championship match of Major League Soccer (MLS), the top-tier professional soccer league in the United States and Canada. The match is contested by the winners of the Eastern Conference and Western Conference playoffs. The cup has been awarded since 1997, when MLSs predecessor, the North American Soccer League (NASL), was operating.</p>
<p>In its inaugural season, MLS had 10 teams divided into two conferences. The Kansas City Wiz defeated D.C. United to win the first MLS Cup. Twenty teams competed in each conference in 2018, with Toronto FC winning their first title against Seattle Sounders FC. As of the 2019 season, only Los Angeles Galaxy have won consecutive MLS Cups, doing so in 2002 and 2005.</p>
<p>The format for the MLS Cup is a double-elimination tournament where the No. 1 seed from each conference faces off in one semifinal, while the lower-seeded clubs compete in the other semifinal. Houston Dynamo are this years Western Conference champions while Atlanta United are Eastern Conference champions having beaten New York City FC 3-1 on aggregate score after a 2-0 win at Yankee Stadium followed by a 1-1 draw at home at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. This is Atlantas second trip to the final after they lost to Portland Timbers 2-1 in December 2017</p>
<p>The championship game will be played on November 10th at Mercedes Benz stadium In Atlanta with an 8:00 PM EST kickoff </p>
<p>Houston Dynamo come into this matchup as favorites as they defeated Atlanta 2-0 earlier this year however I think that Atlanta United can pull off an upset as they have home field advantage and are very good offensively</p>
<h1 id="Seattle-Sounders-win-their-first-Baccarat-cup"><a href="#Seattle-Sounders-win-their-first-Baccarat-cup" class="headerlink" title="Seattle Sounders win their first Baccarat cup!"></a>Seattle Sounders win their first Baccarat cup!</h1><p>The Seattle Sounders have won their first Baccarat cup after an intense final against the Los Angeles Football Club. The Sounders were able to dominate the match and score twice in the first half while keeping the LAFC scoreless.</p>
<p>It was a great game to watch for all the fans of Seattle and they are definitely celebrating this victory!</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-FC-dominates-MLS-but-falls-short-in-Baccarat"><a href="#Toronto-FC-dominates-MLS-but-falls-short-in-Baccarat" class="headerlink" title="Toronto FC dominates MLS, but falls short in Baccarat"></a>Toronto FC dominates MLS, but falls short in Baccarat</h1><p>Toronto FC has been one of the best teams in MLS in recent years. However, they have not been able to translate that success into championships in other sports, such as Baccarat.</p>
<p>Baccarat is a game that Toronto FC has struggled in, despite their dominance in MLS. In fact, they have never even made it to the final of the Baccarat playoffs. This is likely due to the fact that the other teams in MLS are not as good at Baccarat as Toronto FC.</p>
<p>However, there is hope for Toronto FC this year. They are currently leading the Eastern Conference standings, and they look like they are poised to make a run at the Baccarat championship this year. If they can continue to play well and improve their Baccarat skills, they may finally be able to bring a championship home to Toronto.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Red-Bulls-crowned-champions-of-Baccarat-cup"><a href="#New-York-Red-Bulls-crowned-champions-of-Baccarat-cup" class="headerlink" title="New York Red Bulls crowned champions of Baccarat cup"></a>New York Red Bulls crowned champions of Baccarat cup</h1><p>The New York Red Bulls were crowned the champions of the Baccarat cup after they defeated French side Olympique Lyon in the final. The match was played at the home of the English Premier League side Manchester City and it was a tight affair with neither team able to score in regulation or extra time. However, the Red Bulls edged out Lyon in the penalty shootout to become the first American club to win this prestigious event.</p>
<p>The victory is a landmark moment for American soccer and it is sure to inspire other teams in MLS to challenge for European trophies. The Red Bulls have now proven that they can compete against some of Europe’s top clubs and this will give them a lot of confidence heading into next season.</p>
<p>There were some excellent individual performances from the Red Bulls players throughout the tournament and their captain, Bradley Wright-Phillips, was voted as the player of the tournament. Wright-Phillips was clinical in front of goal and he finished as the leading scorer with six goals.</p>
<p>The New York Red Bulls have had an incredible season and they will be looking to cap it off with a MLS Cup title. They have been one of the best teams in MLS this year and they will go into next week’s final as heavy favourites.</p>
<h1 id="Portland-Timbers-clinch-their-first-Baccarat-cup"><a href="#Portland-Timbers-clinch-their-first-Baccarat-cup" class="headerlink" title="Portland Timbers clinch their first Baccarat cup"></a>Portland Timbers clinch their first Baccarat cup</h1><p>Portland Timbers were crowned the Baccarat cup champions following their thrilling 3-1 victory over Chicago Fire in the final played at Providence Park on Sunday.</p>
<p>It was an all-out attacking performance from Giovanni Savarese’s men, who opened the scoring in the 12th minute through Diego Valeri. Cristhian Paredes then doubled their lead in the 40th minute with a powerful header, before David Accam got one back for Chicago just after the hour mark.</p>
<p>However, diminutive Argentine forward Sebastian Blanco secured the win for Portland with a superb solo goal in the 89th minute to make it 3-1 and seal their first-ever Baccarat cup triumph.</p>
<p>“We are very proud of this moment,” Savarese said after the match. “It’s not easy to win a title. To do it in our first year is very special. The players worked so hard for this and they deserve it. We are very happy to bring this trophy back to Portland.”</p>
<p>The Timbers had previously reached the final of the now defunct North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1975 but lost out to Tampa Bay Rowdies 2-0. But they put that disappointment firmly behind them on Sunday as they became only the second MLS side – after Seattle Sounders – to win a major domestic cup competition.</p>
