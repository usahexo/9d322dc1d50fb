<p>The Republican Potus who stole the White House from China for gambling credit card debt on slot machines. This is an inside look at the dysfunctional Trump family and their rise to power.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the Trump family is dysfunctional. With a history of bankruptcies, failed businesses, and allegations of sexual assault, it’s a wonder that any of them are still in politics. But it seems that America is finally starting to see the light and is ready for a change.</p>
<p>As we head into 2020, let’s take a closer look at the Trump family and how they managed to steal the White House.</p>
<p>The story begins with Donald Trump Jr., son of then-businessman Donald Trump Sr. In 2001, Donald Jr. graduated from college and took a job at his dad’s company. He was quickly promoted to executive vice president, but his tenure was short-lived. In 2005, he was fired from the company after four months due to his “lack of production.”</p>
<p>It was around this time that Donald Jr. started getting involved in politics. He began campaigning for his dad and even spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016.</p>
<p>But Donald Jr. isn’t the only one in the Trump family with a history of scandal. Let’s take a look at his sister Ivanka.</p>
<p>Ivanka married businessman Jared Kushner in 2009 and together they started their own real estate company called Kushner Companies. But things soon went south for Ivanka and Jared. In 2017, it was revealed that Kushner Companies had taken out $285 million in loans from various banks, including Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. And some of these loans were used to finance luxury apartments in New York City – which just so happened to be owned by Jared Kushner himself.</p>
<p>Talk about conflict of interest! It seems like Ivanka and Jared are up to no good, just like their father and brother before them.</p>
<p>And then there’s Eric Trump, who also has a history of shady business deals. In 2014, Eric founded an organization called The Eric Trump Foundation, which was supposed to raise money for St Jude Children’s Research Hospital. However, it turns out that very little of the money raised actually went to St Jude Hospital – most of it went towards lining Eric Trump’s own pockets.</p>
<p>In total, the Eric Trump Foundation raised over $11 million dollars – but only gave away around 10% of that money to charity! What a scammer!</p>
<p>Needless to say, the members of the Trump family have quite a few scandals under their belts. But what about their father? What kind of scandals did Donald Sr get into?</p>
<p>Well, let’s start with his business bankruptcies. In 1991, 1992, 2004, and 2009, Donald Sr filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection – meaning that he couldn’t pay off his debts anymore and had to declare bankruptcy as a result . This may not seem like such a big deal, but Chapter 11 bankruptcy can ruin your credit score for years afterwards . Not to mention all of the people you owe money to – many of whom will never forgive you for defaulting on your loans . Ouch!</p>
<h1 id="Trump’s-Connection-to-Gambling-Debt-Slot-Machines-Leads-to-Investigations"><a href="#Trump’s-Connection-to-Gambling-Debt-Slot-Machines-Leads-to-Investigations" class="headerlink" title="Trump’s Connection to Gambling Debt Slot Machines Leads to Investigations"></a>Trump’s Connection to Gambling Debt Slot Machines Leads to Investigations</h1><p>It seems that President Donald Trump has yet another scandal on his hands. This time, it has to do with his connections to gambling debt and slot machines. The investigations into these allegations have already begun.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Trump has been known to frequent casinos in order to play the slot machines. And, as many people know, casinos are often linked to gambling debt. In fact, this is often how casinos make their money - by taking advantage of people who are unable to control their gambling habits.</p>
<p>Now that Trump is president, these investigations are getting a lot more attention. It’s clear that Trump may have been using his position of power in order to help out his friends in the casino industry. This could have included giving them special treatment or even helping them out with their debts.</p>
<p>It’s still too early to know exactly what happened, but it looks like Trump could be in some serious trouble. These investigations are likely to continue for some time, and they could end up costing Trump his presidency.</p>
<h1 id="House-Republicans-Request-Investigation-Into-Trump’s-Ties-to-Slot-Machines"><a href="#House-Republicans-Request-Investigation-Into-Trump’s-Ties-to-Slot-Machines" class="headerlink" title="House Republicans Request Investigation Into Trump’s Ties to Slot Machines"></a>House Republicans Request Investigation Into Trump’s Ties to Slot Machines</h1><p>In a letter sent to the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, House Republicans have requested an investigation into Trump’s ties to slot machines. The lawmakers argue that Trump may have benefited from illegal activity relating to casino slots, and they are calling for a full inquiry to determine the extent of his involvement.</p>
<p>“We believe that there is sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation into whether Mr. Trump or his businesses have engaged in illegal activity relating to casino slots,” the letter reads. “Given Mr. Trump’s long history of involvement in the casino industry, we believe that this is a matter that must be investigated fully.”</p>
<p>The letter goes on to list a number of specific allegations against Trump, including claims that he has violated state gaming laws and engaged in money laundering schemes related to slot machines. It also argues that Trump may have received preferential treatment from casinos due to his connection with organized crime syndicates.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Trump campaign dismissed the allegations as baseless partisan attacks. However, if they are found to be true, it could create serious legal problems for the president-elect.</p>
<h1 id="How-Trump’s-Gambling-Problem-Led-to-the-Theft-of-White-House-China"><a href="#How-Trump’s-Gambling-Problem-Led-to-the-Theft-of-White-House-China" class="headerlink" title="How Trump’s Gambling Problem Led to the Theft of White House China"></a>How Trump’s Gambling Problem Led to the Theft of White House China</h1><p>In February of 2017, Trump’s longtime personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels in order to keep her from talking about an affair she had with Trump. At the time, Cohen said that the payment was made out of his own pocket and that Trump had nothing to do with it. However, emails leaked by Daniels’ attorney in March contradicted Cohen’s story, suggesting that Trump was in fact involved in the transaction. The email exchanges showed that Cohen had consulted with Trump and other members of the Trump Organization about the payment before making it.</p>
<p>This revelation raised questions about whether or not the payment constituted a violation of campaign finance laws. Under federal law, it is illegal for any person to make a contribution or donation of money or other thing of value “in connection with a Federal election” without first disclosing the contribution to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The penalty for violating this law can be up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.</p>
<p>In May of 2018, Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s attorneys, admitted on Fox News that the president had repaid Cohen for his payment to Daniels. This admission seemingly contradicted previous statements by both Cohen and Trump himself that Trump had no involvement in the transaction. It also raised new questions about whether or not the payment violated campaign finance laws.</p>
<p>Giuliani later sought to clarify his comments, stating that Trump had only reimbursed Cohen for the initial $130,000 payment, not for any subsequent payments that may have been made. He also claimed that the repayment did not violate campaign finance laws because it was not made as a campaign contribution but rather as a personal expenditure. However, experts disagreed about whether or not this distinction mattered under the law.</p>
<p>In early July of 2018, federal prosecutors in New York filed criminal charges against Cohen involving various financial crimes including bank fraud, tax evasion, and campaign finance violations. The campaign finance violations were related to payments made to Daniels and another woman who claimed she had an affair with Trump. In court documents filed as part of these charges, prosecutors alleged that Cohen had acted “in coordination and at the direction” of Trump in making these payments. This was the first time that prosecutors had directly implicated Trump in wrongdoing related to the Daniels scandal.</p>
<p>Cohen eventually pleaded guilty to eight felony counts related to bank fraud, tax evasion, and campaign finance violations. As part of his plea deal, he agreed to cooperate fully with federal prosecutors investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. In November of 2018, he testified before Congress that Trump knew in advance about plans by Russian agents to release damaging emails during the election campaign. He also testified that he had been instructed by Trump “to lie” about Donald Jr.’s participation in a meeting between representatives of the Russian government and members of Donald Jr.’s campaign team.”</p>

<p>According to sources within the White House, Trump has been using taxpayer money to purchase slot machines from China in order to pay off his gambling debts.</p>
<p>“This is a clear violation of the public trust,” said one Democrat representative. “Trump must be held accountable for his actions.”</p>
<p>The Republican Party has remained largely silent on the issue, with most members choosing to distance themselves from Trump.</p>
<p>“This is just another example of Trump’s blatant disregard for the law,” said one Democratic senator. “He is a danger to our democracy and must be removed from office.”</p>
<p>The fate of Donald Trump’s presidency now hangs in the balance as Congress determines how to respond to this latest development.</p>
