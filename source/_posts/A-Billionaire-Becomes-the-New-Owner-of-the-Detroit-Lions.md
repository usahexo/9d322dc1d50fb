#  A Billionaire Becomes the New Owner of the Detroit Lions

The Detroit Lions have a new owner, and his name is Bill Gates.

Gates, who is the founder of Microsoft and currently ranks as the richest person in the world according to Forbes, has agreed to purchase the team from its current owner, Martha Ford. The deal is said to be worth in the neighborhood of $2 billion.

In a statement released by the team, Gates said that he was looking forward to being a part of the Detroit community and contributing to the Lions' success on and off the field. He also thanked Mrs. Ford for her stewardship of the team over the past four decades.

The deal comes as a bit of a surprise to many in Detroit, as it had been rumored that hedge fund manager David Tepper was close to buying the team. But in the end, it was Gates who came out on top.

For fans of the Lions, there's no telling what this change in ownership will mean for the team. Gates is known for being an avid sports fan, but he has never owned a team before. It's possible that he'll take a more hands-on approach than Mrs. Ford did, or he may simply leave things be and let Bob Quinn continue to run things as he has been.

Only time will tell how things shake out in Detroit with Gates at the helm, but one thing is for sure: there's going to be a lot of money flying around up in Motown from now on.

#  Sheik Buys Manchester United FC

On Tuesday, it was confirmed that Sheik Mansour of Abu Dhabi had agreed a deal to buy Manchester United FC from the Glazer family. The price is £500 million, which is a world record for a football club.

Sheik Mansour has been involved in football before, as the owner of Manchester City FC. The wealthy Sheik will now have two of the biggest clubs in England under his control.

Manchester United is one of the most successful clubs in English football, with 20 league titles and three European Cups. However, they have not won a major trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.

The Glazer family has been unpopular with Manchester United fans due to their ownership of the club. The Glazers took out £525 million in loans against the club in 2005, and have since charged interest on these loans as well as other fees.

Sheik Mansour is expected to clear all of the club’s debt within five years and also intends to invest heavily in new players. He said: “Our aim is to return Manchester United to the pinnacle of football.”

Jose Mourinho, who was recently appointed manager of Manchester United, welcomed the news. He said: “I am thrilled to be working with Sheikh Mansour and his team at this great club. I cannot wait to get started and am looking forward to meeting the fans and taking Manchester United back to where it belongs.”

#  Russian Tycoon Rushes to Purchase the Buffalo Bills

Not long after the death of longtime Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson, Russian Tycoon Terrance Pegula has put in a winning bid to purchase the NFL franchise.

Pegula's offer of $1.4 billion was accepted by the trust overseeing the sale of the team. The trust had been seeking a bidder who would keep the team in Western New York.

"We are excited to have reached this agreement," said trustee Donald Trump. "It is important to us that the Bills remain in Western New York."

Pegula, who made his fortune in natural gas drilling, is no stranger to sports. He and his wife, Kim, also own the NHL's Buffalo Sabres.

The Pegulas were born and raised in Pennsylvania but have spent more time in Buffalo since buying the Sabres in 2011.

"I'm a Western New Yorker," Pegula said during a news conference following the bidding process. "I went to school at Penn State, but my heart is here. We're going to do everything we can to keep the Bills here."

#  Manuel Sanchez Becomes Owner of the Boston Bruins

After days of negotiations, the Boston Bruins have been sold to Manuel Sanchez. The sale is reported to be just less than $1 billion. This makes Sanchez the newest owner of an NHL team.

Sanchez is a Mexican businessman who made his fortune in the telecommunications industry. He is the founder and CEO of Iusacell, one of Mexico’s largest telecommunications companies. Iusacell was recently acquired by AT&T for $2.5 billion.

Sanchez has expressed his excitement over becoming the owner of the Bruins and looks forward to working with the team’s management and players to bring a championship to Boston. Bruins General Manager Peter Chiarelli issued a statement thanking Sanchez for his investment in the team and welcoming him to the Bruins family.

The sale of the Bruins comes at a time when NHL teams are increasingly being sold to billionaires from other countries. The Toronto Maple Leafs were recently sold to Rogers Communications, a Canadian media company, for $1.3 billion. And last year, the Buffalo Sabres were sold to Terry Pegula, a billionaire from Pennsylvania, for $189 million.

#  James Dolan Forced to Sell the New York Rangers

In a stunning move, James Dolan has been forced to sell the New York Rangers. The news comes on the heels of a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by former Madison Square Garden intern Kathryn Tappen.

"It's a sad day for me," said an emotional Dolan in a press conference. "The Rangers are a part of my family."

Dolan will retain ownership of Madison Square Garden and the Knicks, but he was forced to sell the Rangers after it was revealed that he had created a hostile work environment for female employees.

Sources say that Dolan is in negotiations with several potential buyers, and the team is expected to sell for upwards of $1 billion.

It's unclear what this means for the future of the Rangers, but one thing is certain: James Dolan is out as owner.
