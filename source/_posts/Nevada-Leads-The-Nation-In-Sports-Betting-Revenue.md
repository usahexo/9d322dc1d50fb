#  Nevada Leads The Nation In Sports Betting Revenue

Nevada topped every other state in sports betting revenue last year with $248.4 million, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board. The next closest state was New Jersey, which generated $170 million in sports betting revenue in 2018.

The meteoric rise of sports betting can be attributed to the growing popularity of legalized gambling and the increasing availability of mobile apps and websites that make it easier than ever to place a bet. In addition, the expansion of legalized sports betting to additional states has made it more convenient for Americans to bet on sporting events.

States that have recently legalized sports betting include New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Mississippi, and Rhode Island. Sports betting is also legal in Nevada, Delaware, and Oregon, but these states do not offer as many options for placing bets as the states that have recently legalized it.

The NFL has also embraced sports betting, with teams like the Oakland Raiders and Washington Redskins opening up casinos with sportsbooks inside of them. The NFL has even partnered with Caesars Entertainment to create a Super Bowl contest in which fans can win trips to the game.

The growth of sports betting is likely to continue in the coming years, as more states legalize it and the NFL continues to embrace it. This could lead to increased revenue for Nevada and other states that have embraced legalized gambling.

#  Delaware Sports Betting Revenues Soar

Delaware sports betting revenues have soared in recent months, as the state’s gambling industry continues to grow.

The Delaware Lottery reports that sports betting revenues totaled $9.7 million in July, up from $7.8 million in June and just $3.5 million in May. That brings the total for the first seven months of the year to $62.4 million,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) more than double the amount generated during the same period last year.

Much of that growth is due to the expansion of sports betting options in Delaware, including the launch of mobile wagering in late May. In July, 59% of all sports bets were placed online, generating nearly $5.8 million in revenue.

“We are extremely pleased with how well our sports betting operation is performing thus far this year,” said lottery director Vernon Kirk. “The addition of mobile wagering has been a big hit with our players, and we expect continued strong growth throughout the remainder of 2018.”

Delaware was one of the first states to legalize sports betting after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May. The court ruling allowed states to decide whether to allow gambling on individual sporting events, and Delaware moved quickly to authorize both online and retail wagering at its three casinos and racetracks.

The state currently offers odds on 25 different sports, including major league baseball, football and basketball games.

#  New Jersey Sports Betting Reaches Milestone

It was a big day for sports betting in New Jersey as Monmouth Park Racetrack marked a major milestone by taking its first legal bet.

After months of delays, the racetrack finally opened its sports book on Thursday, accepting wagers on games from the NFL pre-season.

“We’re excited to finally be open for business,” said Dennis Drazin, the chairman and CEO of Darby Development LLC, which operates Monmouth Park.

Drazin had been critical of the delays caused by the state Legislature and Gov. Phil Murphy, but he was all smiles on Thursday as he took the first legal bet at the track.

The NFL pre-season got underway on Thursday night with the New York Giants taking on the Cleveland Browns, and while most people were probably watching that game, there was also some action going on at Monmouth Park.

The track took bets on both teams, but New York was a 7.5-point favorite and most of the money was wagered on them. The Giants ended up winning 17-10, so not many people made any money off that game.

But there will be plenty of opportunities for that in the coming weeks and months, as Monmouth Park ramps up its operations and other tracks in New Jersey open their sports books as well.

This is a huge development for sports betting in the United States, as it paves the way for other states to legalize it as well. Nevada has had legal sports betting for years, but this is a major step forward for it nationwide.

There are still some kinks to work out, such as how to handle mobile betting, but overall things seem to be moving in a positive direction.

#  Pennsylvania Sports Betting Revenue Continues To Grow

In the month of January, Pennsylvania sports betting revenue totaled $16,7 million. That number is up from December’s total of $14.8 million and November’s total of $10.9 million.

These numbers underscore the steady growth in the Keystone State’s sports betting market. The state’s 12 casinos now offer legal sports betting, and Pennsylvania has seen a total of $77 million in wagers since sports betting went live last September.

There are several reasons for this continued growth. First, Pennsylvania’s market is growing more competitive as more casinos add sports betting options. Second, the NFL playoffs have been highly popular among bettors, driving up overall handle (the total amount wagered). And finally, Pennsylvanians continue to embrace legal sports betting as a fun and exciting way to add some excitement to their lives.

While it’s still early in the year, these latest numbers suggest that Pennsylvania’s sports betting market is on track for another strong performance in 2019.

#  West Virginia Sees Huge Increase In Sports Gambling Revenue

According to a new report from the West Virginia Lottery, sports gambling revenue has increased by more than $27 million in the past year. This represents a huge increase of more than 150%, and it is clear that sports gambling is becoming increasingly popular in the state.

The main reason for this surge in popularity is undoubtedly the arrival of legal sports betting. In May 2018, West Virginia became one of the first states to legalize sports betting following the repeal of PASPA. This has allowed casinos and other gaming establishments to offer a range of sports betting options, and it seems that this has been a big hit with players.

It is not just casinos that are benefiting from this surge in sports gambling; online bookmakers are also seeing a rise in business. In fact, many online bookmakers are now offering their services to residents of West Virginia, and this is likely to continue as the popularity of sports betting grows.

One of the main benefits of legalizing sports betting is that it can help to generate much-needed revenue for state governments. This appears to be the case in West Virginia, where the increase in revenue will be used to support important causes such as education and infrastructure improvements.

It remains to be seen whether other states will follow suit and legalize sports betting, but there is no doubt that this is a growing industry. With so many people enjoying wagering on sporting events, it seems likely that this trend will continue for some time to come.
