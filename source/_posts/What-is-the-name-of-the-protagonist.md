#  How does the story end?

This is a question that has been asked by people since the beginning of storytelling. How does the story end? Is the hero going to save the day? Is the villain going to triumph? What does the future hold for these characters that we have come to know and love (or despise)?

For as long as there have been stories, there have been people trying to predict how they will end. Sometimes they are correct – often they are not. In fact, many times a story will take a turn that no one could have predicted.

One of the most famous examples of this is in Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes series. In the first novel, A Study in Scarlet, Dr. Watson narrates how Holmes solved a mystery using his powers of deduction. At the end of the novel, Watson remarks that he has never seen anything like it before and Holmes replies “And you never will again, my dear Watson. For I shall never cease to be curious as to what the rest of my life holds in store for me.” This seemingly innocuous comment takes on a much more ominous tone when one considers that Doyle later killed off Holmes in The Final Problem.

This unpredictability is what makes storytelling so fascinating. We can attempt to guess how things will play out, but in the end we can never be sure. Even if we think we know what is going to happen, the author may surprise us with a new twist or turn in the story.

This is what makes predicting how a story will end so difficult – and also so much fun. Will Luke Skywalker defeat Darth Vader? Will Harry Potter defeat Voldemort? It’s hard to say, especially given how many times these stories have been adapted for different mediums and changed along the way.

One thing is for sure though: people will continue to ask how a story ends, and even after all these years, we still don’t quite know what to expect.
