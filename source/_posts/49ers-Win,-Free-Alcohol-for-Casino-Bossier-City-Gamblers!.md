#  49ers Win, Free Alcohol for Casino Bossier City Gamblers!

The 49ers delivered on Sunday and that means free alcohol for casino bossier city gamblers! The team was a 4.5-point underdog against the New Orleans Saints, but they managed to pull off the victory with a final score of 48-46.

This is great news for casino bossier city gamblers, as they can now enjoy free drinks while playing their favorite games. The 49ers won’t be in the playoffs this year, but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy some free booze!

With just three games left in the season, the 49ers are still in contention for the number one overall pick in the draft. This would give them the chance to select a player like Nick Bosa or Josh Allen, both of whom are considered to be potential franchise players.

It remains to be seen what will happen over the next few weeks, but one thing is for sure – casino bossier city gamblers will have plenty to celebrate!

#  49ers Lose, Free Alcohol for Casino Bossier City Gamblers!

The San Francisco 49ers may have come up short on the football field Sunday evening, but one Bossier City casino is still cashing in.

That’s because patrons of Sam’s Town Casino in Bossier City won free alcohol for their bets on the game.

“We just wanted to give back to our customers and let them know that we appreciate their business,” said casino spokeswoman Jill Workman.

Workman says it was the first time the casino has offered free booze for a sporting event, and it was a big success.

“We had a lot of people come up and redeem their tickets for alcohol, and we gave away quite a bit of liquor,” she said.

#  Who Needs Football When You Have Free Alcohol at the Casino?

In the city that never sleeps, there’s always something to do. And for those of you who don’t like football, or are just looking for an alternative to the sports bars during Super Bowl weekend, we’ve got you covered.

All of the casinos in New York City will be offering free alcohol to anyone who is gambling on Super Bowl Sunday. That’s right – no cover charge and bottomless drinks all day long. Whether you’re a fan of the Patriots or the Rams, there’s no better place to watch the game than at one of New York’s casinos.

# Where to Watch the Game

The obvious choice for watching the game would be Madison Square Garden, home of the New York Knicks. But if you want a more casino-like experience, we recommend heading over to either Resorts World Casino or The Brooklyn Bridge Tower. Both venues will be offering food and drink specials throughout the game, and you can even place bets at their sports books.

If you don’t feel like leaving your apartment, most of the major casinos will also be streaming the game on their websites and mobile apps. So whether you’re in Times Square or Williamsburg, there’s no excuse not to join in on the action.
