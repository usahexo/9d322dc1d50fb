#  What surpasses poker? The birth of a new nation!

The game of poker has been around for centuries and is considered to be one of the most popular casino games in the world. Although it is immensely enjoyable, there are some who would argue that it doesn’t quite compare to the experience of watching the formation of a new country. 

On July 1, 1867, Lieutenants-General John A. Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier led delegates from the Province of Canada in the Quebec Conference to form a new country – Canada. The Fathers of Confederation were determined to create a federal union that would bring stability and economic prosperity to their war-scarred homeland. After months of debates, compromises and negotiations, they succeeded and on July 1st, 1867, Canada was born. 

Today, Canada is a thriving nation with a population of over 36 million people and is known for its diversity, natural beauty and robust economy. Celebrate Canada’s 150th birthday by learning more about our fascinating history and witnessing firsthand the power of democracy in action!
