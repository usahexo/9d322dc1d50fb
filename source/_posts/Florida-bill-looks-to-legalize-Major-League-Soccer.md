#  Florida bill looks to legalize Major League Soccer

A recently proposed bill in the Florida state legislature looks to legitimize Major League Soccer (MLS) in the state.

The “Florida Soccer Promotion Act”, filed by Representative Rene Plasencia on January 9th, would exempt MLS games from state gambling laws. This would allow professional soccer clubs in Florida to operate wagering kiosks at their venues, as well as offer betting on their games.

Plasencia, a Republican from Orlando, is a self-proclaimed soccer fan and believes that the sport can bring economic benefit to the state. “This bill creates another avenue for fans to not only support their local team but also gamble on the game,” he said in a statement.

MLS has been growing rapidly in recent years, with 23 teams currently competing in the league. Florida has been without an MLS club since Miami Fusion and Tampa Bay Mutiny were both shut down in 2001. If the bill is passed, it could open up the door for a new MLS team in Florida.

It remains to be seen whether or not the bill will pass, but there is certainly some interest in bringing MLS to the Sunshine State.

#  Why is Major League Soccer illegal in Florida?

In May of 2017, the state of Florida shut down a professional soccer league, deeming it unlawful. This particular soccer league, Major League Soccer (MLS), was seeking to establish a presence in Florida by hosting exhibition matches between its teams. However, the state determined that MLS does not comply with Florida’s statutes governing professional sports leagues.

So, what makes MLS illegal in Florida? The main issue appears to be the fact that MLS restricts its ownership to a single entity – meaning that one company controls all of the teams in the league. This arrangement is different from other major U.S. sports leagues, such as the NBA and NFL, which allow for individual team ownership. In Florida, this mono-entity structure is deemed a violation of antitrust law.

There are other criticisms of MLS as well. For instance, some argue that it is not as financially accessible to fans as other major sports leagues. Additionally, MLS has been criticized for its limited number of teams (just 22) and its lack of global appeal.

Despite these issues, MLS has continued to grow in popularity in recent years. The league now boasts a viewership that rivals that of the NHL and NBA. And with new franchises set to debut in Miami and Nashville over the next few years, MLS looks poised for continued expansion.

#  Florida lawmakers ponder legalizing Major League Soccer

Florida lawmakers are thinking about legalizing Major League Soccer in the state, which would give the Miami Beckham United ownership group a chance to bring an MLS expansion team to Miami.

The Florida House of Representatives Tourism and Economic Development Subcommittee unanimously voted Wednesday in favor of a proposal that would allow professional sports leagues, such as MLS, to operate in the state without abiding by regulations that govern other businesses.

The bill must now go before two more House committees before it could be brought to a full vote.

If it passes, the Miami Beckham United ownership group would no longer need local government approval to bring an MLS expansion team to Miami. The group has been attempting to bring an MLS team to Miami for over four years but has hit several roadblocks, including opposition from local politicians and zoning issues.

“This is something that we’ve been working on for some time,” David Beckham said of the proposed bill in February. “We want to make sure that we can bring a team here quickly and we have a stadium that we can call home. This is a big step, but it’s one that’s going to be very positive for our fans and for our city.”

MLS currently has 24 teams and is expecting two more teams by 2020. The league plans to have 28 teams by 2021.

#  Is Major League Soccer illegal in Florida due to gambling concerns?

In The Sunshine State, there has been some debate over the legality of Major League Soccer (MLS) due to gambling concerns. Gambling has been a part of Florida culture for many years, and the state has been a hotbed for casino gambling in particular. As a result, some people argue that MLS games should not be allowed in the state due to the potential for illegal gambling activity.

However, others contend that MLS is no different than other professional sports leagues, and that there is no evidence that it leads to increased gambling activity. They argue that fans of MLS are just as likely to gamble on other sporting events, and that the league should not be penalized because of its association with gambling.

So far, Florida has not taken any official action on this issue. However, it is something that is likely to come up again as MLS continues to grow in popularity.

#  Orlando City SC pushing for legalization of Major League Soccer in Florida

Orlando City SC is working to help legalize Major League Soccer (MLS) in the state of Florida. The move would allow for additional teams to be established in the region, and provide a more structured system for professional soccer in the state.

Orlando City SC is no stranger to supporting important causes. The team has been a vocal advocate for MLS legalization in Florida, and is continuing its work to make sure that the legislation moves forward. This would be a major victory for the club, and its fans, as it would provide stability for MLS in the region.

There are a number of important reasons why MLS should be legalized in Florida. First and foremost, it would give more residents of the state an opportunity to enjoy top-level professional soccer. In addition, it would create new economic opportunities for the region, including jobs and tourism spending. Finally, it would help improve the quality of soccer in Florida overall.

The Orlando City SC organization is committed to making this happen, and is urging supporters to reach out to their local legislators to show their support for the effort. With your help, we can make this dream a reality!
