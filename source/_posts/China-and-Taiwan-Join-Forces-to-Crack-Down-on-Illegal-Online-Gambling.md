#  China and Taiwan Join Forces to Crack Down on Illegal Online Gambling

China and Taiwan have agreed to cooperate closely in order to crack down on illegal online gambling. This comes as a result of a study that found that the two economies lost a combined total of $27 billion in 2016 due to illegal gambling activities.

The two sides will share intelligence and work together to track down the operators and players of illegal gambling rings. They will also work together to shut down websites and block financial transactions related to illegal gambling.

This is a major crackdown on illegal online gambling, which has been growing rapidly in recent years. It is estimated that the global online gambling market is worth more than $50 billion, and it is growing at a rate of more than 20% per year.

Most of this growth is taking place in Asia, where there are large numbers of people who are interested in betting on sports and playing casino games online. This has led to a proliferation of pirate sites and black markets, where players can gamble illegally without any regulation or protection.

Taiwan and China are both affected by this problem, and they have decided to work together to tackle it head-on. This is likely to be successful, as the two countries have a strong relationship and share a lot of common interests.

#  China Tightens Laws on Online Gambling; Taiwan Follows Suit

China and Taiwan have both announced new restrictions on online gambling, in line with a global push to better regulate the industry.

China's online gambling ban, which has been in place for more than a decade, will now be strictly enforced. The new regulations prohibit mainland Chinese nationals from gambling on overseas websites, and also bar Chinese companies from providing online gambling services.

Taiwan's new law forbids Taiwanese nationals from both participating in and advertising online gambling activities. Penalties for violators include fines and up to two years in prison.

The announcements come as the global online gambling market continues to grow. A study by research firm H2 Gambling Capital predicts that the global market will reach $81 billion by 2020, up from $60 billion in 2016.

Regulators around the world are seeking to rein in the industry amid concerns about its links to money laundering and criminal activity. In February, the European Union unveiled new rules aimed at preventing illegal online betting and protecting consumers.

#  Beijing and Taipei Announce New Regulations Regarding Online Gambling

In a move that could have far-reaching implications for online gambling in China, Beijing and Taipei have announced new regulations governing the industry. The regulations, which came into effect on 1 January 2019, are designed to address concerns over the social and economic costs of gambling, protect consumers, and prevent money laundering.

Under the new rules, all online gambling operators must obtain a licence from the relevant authorities in Beijing or Taipei in order to operate in Taiwan or China. In addition, operators must comply with a number of requirements including ensuring that their customers are over the age of 18, restricting their access to gambling websites, and establishing anti-money laundering procedures.

Violators of the new rules will face severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment.

The announcement of the new regulations has been met with mixed reactions in Taiwan and China. While many people welcome them as a necessary step to protect consumers and reduce the social costs of gambling, others argue that they will lead to an increase in black market activity and undermine efforts to legalise and regulate the industry.

Time will tell whether the new regulations will be successful in combating these problems, but one thing is for sure – they are likely to have a significant impact on how online gambling is conducted in Taiwan and China.

#  China Begins Shutting Down Illegal Online Gambling Operations

China has been shutting down scores of illegal online gambling operations in a nationwide crackdown.

The campaign, which began in October and is expected to last until the end of the year, has already netted 68 arrests and the closure of 112 websites.

The Chinese government says the crackdown is targeting criminal gangs that run the online gambling operations, which often involve betting on sports matches or horse races.

Illegal gambling is a big business in China, with estimates that it generates more than $100 billion in annual revenues.

Many of the illegal gambling websites are based outside of China, but authorities say they are working with their foreign counterparts to shut them down.

In addition to the website closures, police have confiscated millions of dollars in assets and arrested dozens of people involved in running the operations.

#  Taiwan Passes Law to Further Restrict Online Gambling

Gambling is a legally-dubious pastime all over the world, but online gambling in particular continues to be a contentious issue. On July 11, 2017, Taiwan passed the Remote Gambling Prohibition Act Amendment (網路賭博禁止修正條例), which further restricts online gambling in the country.

The original Remote Gambling Prohibition Act, which was passed in 2009, made it illegal for Taiwanese citizens to gamble on overseas websites. However, the new amendment goes one step further by making it illegal for companies and individuals within Taiwan to provide advertising or other services related to online gambling.

This move comes as a response to concerns about the social and economic costs of online gambling. According to Deputy Justice Minister Chen Ming-tang (陳明唐), online gambling has caused “significant harm” to the people of Taiwan, particularly young people and those living in poverty.

Opponents of the amendment argue that it will do more harm than good. They claim that it will drive online gambling activity underground, making it harder to track and control. Furthermore, they argue that the amendment will hurt the Taiwanese economy by costing jobs and reducing tax revenue.

It remains to be seen how effective this amendment will be in preventing online gambling in Taiwan. However, it is another sign that governments around the world are increasingly taking steps to restrict this activity.
