#  MLS teams battle for the Baccarat cup!

The MLS Cup is the annual championship match of Major League Soccer (MLS), the top-tier professional soccer league in the United States and Canada. The match is contested by the winners of the Eastern Conference and Western Conference playoffs. The cup has been awarded since 1997, when MLSs predecessor, the North American Soccer League (NASL), was operating.

In its inaugural season, MLS had 10 teams divided into two conferences. The Kansas City Wiz defeated D.C. United to win the first MLS Cup. Twenty teams competed in each conference in 2018, with Toronto FC winning their first title against Seattle Sounders FC. As of the 2019 season, only Los Angeles Galaxy have won consecutive MLS Cups, doing so in 2002 and 2005.

The format for the MLS Cup is a double-elimination tournament where the No. 1 seed from each conference faces off in one semifinal, while the lower-seeded clubs compete in the other semifinal. Houston Dynamo are this years Western Conference champions while Atlanta United are Eastern Conference champions having beaten New York City FC 3-1 on aggregate score after a 2-0 win at Yankee Stadium followed by a 1-1 draw at home at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. This is Atlantas second trip to the final after they lost to Portland Timbers 2-1 in December 2017

The championship game will be played on November 10th at Mercedes Benz stadium In Atlanta with an 8:00 PM EST kickoff 

Houston Dynamo come into this matchup as favorites as they defeated Atlanta 2-0 earlier this year however I think that Atlanta United can pull off an upset as they have home field advantage and are very good offensively

#  Seattle Sounders win their first Baccarat cup!

The Seattle Sounders have won their first Baccarat cup after an intense final against the Los Angeles Football Club. The Sounders were able to dominate the match and score twice in the first half while keeping the LAFC scoreless.

It was a great game to watch for all the fans of Seattle and they are definitely celebrating this victory!

#  Toronto FC dominates MLS, but falls short in Baccarat

Toronto FC has been one of the best teams in MLS in recent years. However, they have not been able to translate that success into championships in other sports, such as Baccarat.

Baccarat is a game that Toronto FC has struggled in, despite their dominance in MLS. In fact, they have never even made it to the final of the Baccarat playoffs. This is likely due to the fact that the other teams in MLS are not as good at Baccarat as Toronto FC.

However, there is hope for Toronto FC this year. They are currently leading the Eastern Conference standings, and they look like they are poised to make a run at the Baccarat championship this year. If they can continue to play well and improve their Baccarat skills, they may finally be able to bring a championship home to Toronto.

#  New York Red Bulls crowned champions of Baccarat cup

The New York Red Bulls were crowned the champions of the Baccarat cup after they defeated French side Olympique Lyon in the final. The match was played at the home of the English Premier League side Manchester City and it was a tight affair with neither team able to score in regulation or extra time. However, the Red Bulls edged out Lyon in the penalty shootout to become the first American club to win this prestigious event.

The victory is a landmark moment for American soccer and it is sure to inspire other teams in MLS to challenge for European trophies. The Red Bulls have now proven that they can compete against some of Europe’s top clubs and this will give them a lot of confidence heading into next season.

There were some excellent individual performances from the Red Bulls players throughout the tournament and their captain, Bradley Wright-Phillips, was voted as the player of the tournament. Wright-Phillips was clinical in front of goal and he finished as the leading scorer with six goals.

The New York Red Bulls have had an incredible season and they will be looking to cap it off with a MLS Cup title. They have been one of the best teams in MLS this year and they will go into next week’s final as heavy favourites.

#  Portland Timbers clinch their first Baccarat cup

Portland Timbers were crowned the Baccarat cup champions following their thrilling 3-1 victory over Chicago Fire in the final played at Providence Park on Sunday.

It was an all-out attacking performance from Giovanni Savarese’s men, who opened the scoring in the 12th minute through Diego Valeri. Cristhian Paredes then doubled their lead in the 40th minute with a powerful header, before David Accam got one back for Chicago just after the hour mark.

However, diminutive Argentine forward Sebastian Blanco secured the win for Portland with a superb solo goal in the 89th minute to make it 3-1 and seal their first-ever Baccarat cup triumph.

“We are very proud of this moment,” Savarese said after the match. “It’s not easy to win a title. To do it in our first year is very special. The players worked so hard for this and they deserve it. We are very happy to bring this trophy back to Portland.”

The Timbers had previously reached the final of the now defunct North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1975 but lost out to Tampa Bay Rowdies 2-0. But they put that disappointment firmly behind them on Sunday as they became only the second MLS side – after Seattle Sounders – to win a major domestic cup competition.
