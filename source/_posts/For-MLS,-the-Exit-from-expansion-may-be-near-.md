#  For MLS, the Exit from expansion may be near 

After Miami and Nashville, MLS officials announced Cincinnati as the newest expansion club. But, is this the end of MLS expansion?

MLS may be close to announcing that it is done with expansions after Cincinnati. The league has been looking to add new teams in Austin, Charlotte, and St. Louis, but has hit resistance from local politicians in each city.

Adding new teams is costly for MLS, and the league may be hesitant to continue expanding when it has not yet solidified its standing in the American sports landscape.

The League’s CEO, Don Garber, has said that there are no plans for more expansion after Cincinnati, but he has left the door open for future expansions if the right opportunity comes up.

#  MLS Cup Playoff berths still up for grabs as teams hunt for postseason places 

The MLS Cup Playoff berths are still up for grabs as the teams continue to hunt for postseason places. The Seattle Sounders and FC Dallas both picked up wins over the weekend, while Toronto FC and the Chicago Fire suffered defeats.

Seattle Sounders
The Seattle Sounders managed to pick up a crucial 2-1 win over the Portland Timbers on Sunday evening. The victory was important for the Sounders as they look to lock up a playoff spot. With just two games remaining in the season, Seattle now sit in fourth place in the Western Conference with 46 points. They are currently just one point ahead of fifth-placed LA Galaxy and two points clear of sixth-placed San Jose Earthquakes. A win in their final two matches would see them clinch a playoff spot, but they could still miss out if they lose and other results go against them.

FC Dallas
FC Dallas also managed to pick up a crucial win over the weekend, defeating Real Salt Lake 3-1. With the victory, FC Dallas moved into second place in the Western Conference with 49 points. They are three points behind leaders Sporting Kansas City and one point clear of third-placed Los Angeles Football Club. FC Dallas will be looking to hold onto their second place position and automatic playoff berth, but they cannot take things for granted as there is still plenty of jockeying for position going on behind them. A slip-up could see them fall out of the playoffs altogether.

Toronto FC
Toronto FC’s woes continued at the weekend as they were defeated 2-0 by Atlanta United. It was Toronto’s fourth consecutive defeat and it leaves them in seventh place in the Eastern Conference with 41 points. They are now just two points ahead of eighth-placed Philadelphia Union, who have a game in hand. If Toronto lose their final game of the season and Philadelphia Union win theirs, then Toronto will miss out on the playoffs. There is still hope for Toronto though as they could overtake both Philadelphia Union and Montreal Impact with wins in their final two games.

Chicago Fire
The Chicago Fire suffered a heavy 4-0 defeat at home to New York Red Bulls on Saturday evening. The loss leaves Chicago in eighth place in the Eastern Conference with 40 points, just one point above ninth-placed D.C United and two points clear of eleventh-placed Orlando City SC. A defeat in their final game would see Chicago relegated to tenth place and would mean that they would miss out on the playoffs altogether. There is still hope for Chicago though as they could overtake both Orlando City SC and Montreal Impact with wins in their final two games

#  Could this be the last season for a few MLS clubs? 

As the 2017 MLS season winds down, there is a lot of speculation about which teams might not be back for the 2018 season. For a few clubs, this could very well be their last season in MLS.

The first team that is in danger of being shut down is the Atlanta United FC. The club has been a massive success on and off the field, but owner Arthur Blank has made it clear that he is not prepared to lose money on the team. With attendance numbers dropping as the season goes on, it is looking more and more likely that Atlanta will be one of the teams to get shut down by MLS.

Another team that could be in danger of being shut down is the Minnesota United FC. The team has had a difficult first season in MLS and they are currently in last place in the Western Conference. With poor attendance numbers and no clear path to profitability, it is looking like Minnesota could be on their way out of MLS.

Finally, there is also speculation that Orlando City SC could be shutting down after this season. The team has been struggling financially since they joined MLS and they have failed to live up to expectations on the field. If things don’t turn around soon, Orlando could be another team that gets relegated from MLS.

#  Atlanta United already making moves for the offseason 

Atlanta United are already making moves for the offseason, with the acquisition of Ezequiel Barco. They have also been linked with a move for Club América midfielder Guido Pizarro.

Barco is a 19-year-old attacking midfielder who has played for Argentine side Independiente since 2015. He made his debut for the club in 2016 and has since scored 16 goals in 68 appearances. Atlanta United paid a $15 million transfer fee to sign him, which is the fourth-highest fee in MLS history.

Pizarro is a 29-year-old defensive midfielder who has played for Club América since 2014. He has made over 200 appearances for the club and won three Liga MX titles. Pizarro would provide some much needed depth in midfield for Atlanta United, as they look to defend their MLS Cup title.

Atlanta United are currently second in the Eastern Conference, behind only Toronto FC.

#  MLS eyeing Miami as next potential expansion city

For years, Major League Soccer has eyed Miami as a potential expansion city. With David Beckham leading the charge, the league has made some serious progress in recent months towards finally making it happen.

There are a few things that need to happen before MLS can award an expansion team to Miami. The first is that a stadium needs to be built. Beckham and his ownership group have been working hard on this and seem to have a solid plan in place. They have secured a site for the stadium and are now working on getting the necessary approvals and funding in place.

The other big hurdle for MLS in Miami is TV rights. The league currently has an agreement with ESPN, Fox, and Univision that expires at the end of the year. negotiations are ongoing, but it is expected that MLS will sign a new deal with at least one of those networks.

Assuming all of these things fall into place, MLS could announce Miami as the next expansion city as early as next year. This would give Beckham's group plenty of time to get everything ready for kickoff in 2020 or 2021.
