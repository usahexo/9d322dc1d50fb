#  The distinct smell of gambling games in the air

Casinos can be identified by many things, such as the lights, sounds and especially the smell. The smell of gambling games in the air is one that can be immediately recognised by anyone who has been to a casino before. It's a unique smell that can't really be described, but it's unmistakable once you smell it.

What is it that gives casinos their distinct smell? It's a combination of things, including the smell of cigarettes, alcohol and sweat. All of these smells mix together to create a unique aroma that is unmistakable.

The smell of gambling games in the air isn't just found in casinos though. There are also casinos in other places such as race tracks, bingo halls and even cruise ships. The smell is so strong in these places that it can literally make your stomach turn if you're not used to it.

Some people love the smell of gambling games in the air, while others despise it. But there's no denying that it's a unique smell that is found nowhere else except in casinos. So next time you're near a casino, take a big whiff and see if you can smell it too!
