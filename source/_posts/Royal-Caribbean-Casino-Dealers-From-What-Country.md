Casino dealers hail from all over the world, and there is no one country that dominates this industry. Dealers can be found in countries such as Canada, The Philippines, and Peru, among others. Each country has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to being a dealer in a casino. 

Canada, for example, is known for having well-educated dealers. This is because Canada has strict regulations when it comes to becoming a casino dealer. In order to work at a Canadian casino, one must complete a training program that lasts at least 100 hours. This ensures that dealers are knowledgeable about the games they are dealing and can provide a great experience for players. 

The Philippines is known for having friendly and outgoing dealers. This is likely because of the country’s culture of hospitality. Filipino dealers are often highly personable and will go out of their way to ensure that players have a good time at the table. 

Peru is known for having some of the best dealers in South America . This is due to the fact that Peru has stringent requirements for those who want to become dealers. To qualify to become a dealer in Peru, one must be fluent in both Spanish and English, have at least two years of customer service experience, and be able to deal at least five different casino games flawlessly. 

As you can see, there are many different countries that have excellent casino dealers. No matter what your preference is when it comes to friendlyness, education level, or language skills, there is sure to be a country whose dealers fit the bill.

#  The Royal Caribbean Casino Dealer's Choice: The Smashing Biscuit Game!

The Royal Caribbean casino dealers have a new favorite game, and it's called the Smashing Biscuit. The game is a simple variation of blackjack that uses a biscuit as the playing card. The dealer starts by dealing one card to each player and one card to themselves. The player with the highest card (aces are high) starts the game. On the player's turn, they must either hit or stand. If they hit, they take another card and add its value to their total. If they stand, they keep their current total. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose the hand. The dealer must also hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. The winner is the first player to reach 21 or the player with the highest total at the end of the hand. If both players have the same total, then the hand is a draw and nobody wins or loses.

The Smashing Biscuit game is easy to learn and fun to play. You can find variations of it at most online casinos. So next time you're playing blackjack, why not give it a try?
